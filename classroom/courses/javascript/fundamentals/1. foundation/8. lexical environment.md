## Intro

A lexical environment is basically the scope the engine is currently reading code in. A new lexical environment is created when curly brackets {} are used, even nested brackets {{...}} create a new lexical environment. The execution context can tell the engine which lexical environment it is currently working in and the lexical scope determines the available variables.

## Lexical vs. Variable Environment

- A lexical environment has a link to any outer lexical environment (e.g. its scope chain), so it is used to resolve identifiers outside the current execution context (e.g. global variables).

- A variable environment is just a part of a lexical environment within the execution context, essentially just the variables and functions declared within the current context. The variable environment is truly just a fancy representation of the lexical environmentâ€™s local memory.

## Example

```javascript
function one() {
  var isValid = true; // local variable environment
  two(); // new execution context
}

function two() {
  var isValid; // local variable environment
}

var isValid = false; // global variable environment

one(); // new execution context

/* 
   two()      isValid = undefined
   one()      isValid = true
   global()   isValid = false
   ----------------------------
   call stack
*/
```
