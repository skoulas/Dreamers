## Intro.

JavaScript is a single threaded language, meaning only one set of instructions can be executed at a time. It only has one call stack and therefore it is a synchronous language.

## Synchronous Execution

So, what is the issue with being a single threaded language? In a synchronous language, only one thing can be done at a time. Imagine an alert on the page, blocking the user from accessing any part of the page until the OK button is clicked. If everything in JavaScript that took a significant amount of time, blocked the browser, then we would have a pretty bad user experience.

## Non-Blocking

JavaScript can be non-blocking! In order to not block the single thread, we can use callback functions. These functions are run in the JavaScript Runtime Environment with the help of Web APIs and are send back to the call stack. In this way we can write asynchronous Javascript, meaning we can run multiple functions at the same time.
