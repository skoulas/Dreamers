## Intro.

JavaScript is a single threaded language, meaning only one set of instructions can be executed at a time. It only has one call stack and therefore it is a synchronous language.

## Synchronous Execution

So, what is the issue with being a single threaded language? In a synchronous language, only one thing can be done at a time. Imagine an alert on the page, blocking the user from accessing any part of the page until the OK button is clicked. If everything in JavaScript that took a significant amount of time, blocked the browser, then we would have a pretty bad user experience.
