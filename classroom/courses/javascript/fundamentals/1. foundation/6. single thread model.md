## Intro

## Thread of Execution

It parses and executes the code line after line.

## Synchronous Execution

So, what is the issue with being a single threaded language? Lets's start from the beginning. When you visit a web page, you run a browser to do so (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Each browser has its own version of JavaScript Runtime with a set of Web API's, methods that developers can access from the window object. In a synchronous language, only one thing can be done at a time. Imagine an alert on the page, blocking the user from accessing any part of the page until the OK button is clicked. If everything in JavaScript that took a significant amount of time, blocked the browser, then we would have a pretty bad user experience. This is where concurrency and the event loop come in.
