## Intro

The JavaScript engine does a lot of work for us, but 2 of the biggest jobs are reading and executing it. We need a place to store and write our data and a place to keep track line by line of what's executing. That's where the call stack and the memory heap come in.

## Memory Heap

The memory heap is a place to store and write information so that we can use our memory appropriately. It is a place to allocate, use, and remove memory as needed. Think of it as a storage room of boxes that are unordered.

```javascript
// tell the memory heap to allocate memory for a number
const number = 17;
// allocate memory for a string
const string = 'kitsos';
// allocate memory for an object and it's values
const person = {
  first: 'George',
  last: 'Pilitsoglou',
};
```

## Call Stack

The call stack keeps track of where we are in the code, so we can run the program in order.

```javascript
function subtractTwo(num) {
  return num - 2;
}

function calculate() {
  const sumTotal = 4 + 5;
  return subtractTwo(sumTotal);
}
debugger;
calculate();
```

Things are placed into the call stack on top and removed as they are finished. It runs in a first in last out mode. Each call stack can point to a location inside the memory heap. In the above snippet the call stack looks like this.

```javascript
anonymous; // file is being ran
// CALL STACK

// hits debugger and stops the file
// step through each line

calculate(
  // steps through calculate() sumTotal = 9
  anonymous
);
// CALL STACK

// steps into subtractTwo(sumTotal) num = 9

subtractTwo; // returns 9 - 2
calculate(anonymous);
// CALL STACK

// subtractTwo() has finished and has been removed

calculate(
  // returns 7
  anonymous
)(
  // CALL STACK

  // calculate() has finished and has been removed

  anonymous
);
// CALL STACK

// and finally the file is finished and is removed

// CALL STACK
```
