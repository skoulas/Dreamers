## Intro

**'This'** is the object that the function is a property of.

## The "this" Keyword

- gives methods acess to their objects
- executes same code for multible objects ('this' functions as a placeholder)

## Dynamic Scoped

The **'this'** Keyword is dynamically scoped. It doesn't matter where it is written but how the function is invoked. _(who called the function?)_

```javascript
const object = {
  sing () {
    console.log ('a: ', this);
    var anotherFunc = function() {
      console.log ('b: ', this);
    }
    anotherFunc()
  }
}

obj.sing() -->

a: object
b: window (global object)
```

How can we solve the above issue?

Arrow functions _(ES6)_ are lexically bound!

```javascript
const object = {
  sing () {
    console.log ('a: ', this);
    var anotherFunc = ()  => {
      console.log ('b: ', this);
    }
    anotherFunc()
  }
}

obj.sing() -->

a: object
b: object
```

--> The **this** Keyword obtains lexical begaviour.

## Context Vs Scope

**Scope** defines the access to variables of a function when the function is invoked. _(Scope is function based)_

**Context** is always the value of the reserved word **this** which is a reference to the object that owns the execution of the code. _(Context is object based)_
