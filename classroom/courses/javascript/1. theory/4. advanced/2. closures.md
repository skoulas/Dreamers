## Intro

Closures allow a function to access variables from an enclosing scope or environment even after it leaves the scope in which it was declared. In other words, a closure gives you access to its outer functions scope from the inner scope. The JavaScript engine will keep variables around inside functions that have a reference to them, instead of "sweeping" them away after they are popped off the call stack.

```javascript
function a() {
  let grandpa = 'grandpa'
  return function b() {
    let father = 'father'
    return function c() {
      let son = 'son'
      return `${grandpa} > ${father} > ${son}`
    }
  }
}

a()()()

// grandpa > father > son


const closure = grandma => mother => daughter => return `${grandma} > ${mother} > ${daughter}`

// grandma > mother > daughter
```

Two of the major reasons closures are so beneficial are memory efficiency and encapsulation. But first lets examine what functions are.

## Functions are Callable Objects

Because functions are objects in JavaScript, this also gives them the ability to have properties added to them. This creates a callable object, a special object that creates properties not available on normal objects. Below is a visualization of how this works under the hood. This code can not be ran in the console, but it is a representation of how the object looks.

```javascript
function say() {
  console.log('say something')
}

say.yell = 'yell something'

// following under the hood visual will not run in the console
const funcObj = {
  // name will not exist if anonymous
  name: 'say',
  // code to be ran
  (): console.log('say something')
  // properties get added
  // apply, arguments, bind, call, caller, length, name, toString
  yell: 'yell something',
}
```

## First Class Citizens

You might hear people say "Functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript". All this means is that functions can be passed around as if they were a JavaScript type. Anything that can be done with other types, can also be done with functions. This introduces JavaScript to a whole different type of programming called functional programming. Below are some examples of how functions work differently in JavaScript.

```javascript
// setting functions to variables:
var setFuncToVar = function () {}

// call function within another:
function a(fn) {
  fn()
}
a(function () {console.log('a new function')}

// return functions within another:
function b() {
  return function c() {console.log('another func')}
}
```

## Higher Order Functions

A Higher Order Function (HOF) is a function that either takes a function as an argument or returns another function. There are 3 types of functions in JavaScript.

```
- function ()
- function (a(=function), b(=function))
- function hof() { return function () {} }
```

Instead of writing multiple functions that do the same thing, remember DRY. Imagine in the example below, if you separated each code out into individual functions for each person loging in how much more code you would be writing and how much code would be repeated. Higher order function can help us write leaner code and keep it generic:

```javascript
const giveAccessTo = (name) => `Access granted to ${name}`;

function auth(verify) {
  let array = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < verify; i++) {
    array.push(i);
  }
  return true;
}

function checkPerson(person, fn) {
  if (person.level === 'admin') {
    fn(500000);
  } else if (person.level === 'user') {
    fn(100000);
  }
  return giveAccessTo(person.name);
}

checkPerson({ level: 'admin', name: 'Brittney' }, auth);
//"Access granted to Brittney"
```

Take a different example below of how higher order functions can help separate code out and break it down to make it more reusable:

```javascript
function multBy(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return a * b;
  };
}

// can also be an arrow function
const multiplyBy = (a) => (b) => a * b;

const multByTwo = multiplyBy(2);
const multByTen = multiplyBy(10);

multByTwo(4); // 8
multByTen(5); // 50
```

## Memory Efficient

Using closures makes your code more memory efficient. Take the example below.

```javascript
function inefficient(idx) {
  const bigArray = new Array(7000).fill('*');
  console.log('created!');
  return bigArray[idx];
}

function efficient() {
  const bigArray = new Array(7000).fill('*');
  console.log('created again!');
  return function (idx) {
    return bigArray[idx];
  };
}

inefficient(688);
inefficient(1000);
inefficient(6500);

const getEfficient = efficient();

getEfficient(688);
getEfficient(1000);
getEfficient(6500);
_;
// created!
// created!
// created!
// created again!
// '*'

// inefficient created the bigArray 3 times
// efficient created the bigArray only once
```

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation means the restriction of direct access to some of an object's components. It hides as much as possible of an object's internal parts and only exposes the necessary parts to run. Why use encapsulation?

- Security - Controlled access
- Hide Implementation and Expose Behaviours
- Loose Coupling - Modify the implementation at any time

```javascript
const encapsulation = () => {
  let people = [];
  const setName = (name) => people.push(name);
  const getName = (idx) => people[idx];

  return {
    setName,
    getName,
  };
};

const data = encapsulation();

data.setName('Brittney');
data.getName(0);

// You have no access to the people array
// You can only change it via methods provided
```
