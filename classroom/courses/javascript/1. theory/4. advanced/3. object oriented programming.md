## Intro

Object Oriented Programming, or OOP, is the idea that all code should be grouped into "boxes" (objects) to make your program easier to read and understand. Keeping the data encapsulated helps to keep the program organized. Each object has a state that defines what it does and methods (functions on an object) that can use or modify the state. Considering almost everything in JavaScript is an object, you would think this would be easy to do. Say we want to create a game that has lots of characters that all have different abilities. How would we go about this?

```javascript

const dobby = {
  name: 'Dobby',
  type: 'house',
  weapon: 'cloth',
  say: function() {
    return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}, I am a ${this.type} elf.`
  }
  attack: function() {
    return `attack with ${this.weapon}`
  }
}

const legolas = {
  name: 'Legolas',
  type: 'high',
  weapon: 'bow',
  say: function() {
    return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}, I am a ${this.type} elf.`
  }
  attack: function() {
    return `attack with ${this.weapon}`
  }
}

dobby.attack()
// attack with cloth

legolas.attack()
// attack with bow
```

## Factory Functions

As you can see, this code is already getting very repetitive and is not maintainable with only one character type. Imagine adding more characters, things would get out of control quickly. So, another way to create objects was introduced, factory functions. Factory functions return a new object every time they are ran. This could improve the code somewhat.

```javascript
function createElf(name, type, weapon) {
  return {
    name: name,
    type: type,
    weapon: weapon,
    say() {
      return `Hi, my name is ${name}, I am a ${type} elf.`;
    },
    attack() {
      return `${name} attacks with ${weapon}`;
    },
  };
}

const dobby = createElf('Dobby', 'house', 'cloth');
const legolas = createElf('Legolas', 'high', 'bow');

dobby.say();
// Hi, my name is Dobby, I am a house elf.

legolas.say();
// Hi, my name is Legolas, I am a high elf.

dobby.attack();
// Dobby attacks with cloth.

legolas.attack();
// Legolas attacks with bow.
```

## Separate common methods

This is a step in the right direction, but if we added more characters, we would run into some of the same issues again. Not only is the code not DRY, the attack method is being created and taking up memory space for every new elf. This is not very efficient. How do we solve this? Well, we could separate the methods out into a store.

```javascript
const elfMethodsStore = {
  say() {
    return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}, I am a ${this.type} elf.`;
  },
  attack() {
    return `attack with ${this.weapon}`;
  },
};

function createElf(name, type, weapon) {
  return {
    name, // (equivalent to name: name)
    type,
    weapon,
  };
}

/*each method has to be assigned to the store method to create the __proto__ chain*/

const dobby = createElf('Dobby', 'house', 'cloth');
dobby.attack = elfMethodsStore.attack;
dobby.say = elfMethodsStore.say;

const legolas = createElf('Legolas', 'high', 'bow');
legolas.attack = elfMethodsStore.attack;
legolas.say = elfMethodsStore.say;
```

## Object.create

Having a store saved us some efficiency in memory, but this was a lot of manual work to assign each method. So, we were given Object.create to help create this chain without having to assign each method.

```javascript
const elfMethodsStore = {
  say() {
    return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}, I am a ${this.type} elf.`;
  },
  attack() {
    return `attack with ${this.weapon}`;
  },
};

function createElf(name, type, weapon) {
  let newElf = Object.create(elfMethodsStore);
  // this creates the __proto__ chain to the store.

  console.log(newElf.__proto__);
  // { say: [Function], attack: [Function] }

  newElf.name = name;
  newElf.type = type;
  newElf.weapon = weapon;

  return newElf;
}

const dobby = createElf('Dobby', 'house', 'cloth');
const legolas = createElf('Legolas', 'high', 'bow');

dobby.attack;
// attack with cloth

legolas.attack;
// attack with bow
```

## Constructor Functions

Using Object.create is true prototypal inheritance, the code is cleaner and easier to read. However, you will not see this being used in most programs. Before Object.create came around, we had the ability to use constructor functions.

```javascript
const five = new Number(5);
const newString = new String(`I am a new string`);
```

The Number and String functions were constructed and invoked with the new keyword and they were capitalized. The new keyword actually changes the meaning of this for the constructor function. Without new, this will point to the window object instead of the object that we just created. It is best practice to capitalize constructor functions to help us identify them and know to use the new keyword. Properties added to a constructor function can only be done using the this keyword, regular variables do not get added to the object.

```javascript
function Elf(name, type, weapon) {
  // constructor functions are typically capitalized

  this.name = name;
  this.type = type;
  this.weapon = weapon;
  // not returning anything, but "constructing" a new elf
}

const dobby = new Elf('Dobby', 'house', 'cloth');
const legolas = new Elf('Legolas', 'high', 'bow');
// to use a constructor function the "new" keyword must be used

Elf.prototype.attack = function () {
  //adding methods to the constructor function

  return `attack with ${this.weapon}`;
  // cannot be an arrow function, because this would be scoped to the window object.
};

// The above would need to be repeated for each method.

dobby.attack();
// attack with cloth

legolas.attack();
// attack with bow
```

A constructor function in JavaScript is actually like a function constructor. So what happens under the hood?

```javascript
const Elf = new Function(
  'name',
  'type',
  'weapon',
  'this.name = name /n this.type = type /n this.weapon = weapon'
);

const dobby = new Elf('Dobby', 'house', 'cloth');
const legolas = new Elf('Legolas', 'high', 'bow');
// This will work exactly the same as our code above.
```

**Nifty Snippet:** _Only functions have access to the prototype._

`legolas.prototype = undefined.`

_=> const legolas is not a function but an object._

## Class

Confused yet? Prototype is a little weird and hard to read unless you really understand your prototypal inheritance. No one really liked using the prototype way of adding methods, so ES6 JavaScript gave us the class keyword. However, classes in JavaScript are not true classes, they are syntactic sugar. Under the hood, it is still using the old prototype method. They are in fact just "special functions" with one big difference; functions are hoisted and classes are not. You need to declare your class before it can be used in your codebase. Classes also come with a new method, the constructor that creates and instantiates an object created with class. Classes are able to be extended upon using the extends keyword, allowing subclasses to be created. If there is a constructor present in the extended class, the super keyword is needed to link the constructor to the base class. You can check if something is inherited from a class by using the keyword instanceof to compare the new object to the class.

```javascript
class Character {
  constructor(name, weapon) {
    this.name = name;
    this.weapon = weapon;
  }
  attack() {
    return `attack with ${this.weapon}`;
  }
}

class Elf extends Character {
  constructor(name, weapon, type) {
    super(name, weapon);
    // pulls in name and weapon from Character
    this.type = type;
  }
}

class Ogre extends Character {
  constructor(name, weapon, color) {
    super(name, weapon);
    // pulls in name and weapon from Character
    this.color = color;
  }
  enrage() {
    return `double attack power`;
  }
}

const legolas = new Elf('Legolas', 'high', 'bow');
const gruul = new Ogre('Gruul', 'club', 'gray');

legolas.attack();
// attack with bow

gruul.enrage();
// double attack power

gruul.attack();
// attack with club

legolas instanceof Elf;
// true

gruul instanceof Ogre;
// true
```

## Method Chaining

Chaining Methods, also known as Cascading, means repeatedly calling one method after another on an object, in one continuous line of code. Let us look at an example where method chaining can help us avoid repetition.

Take the following class car for example:

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor() {
    this.doors = 4;
    this.topSpeed = 100;
  }
  setDoors(d) {
    this.doors = d;
  }
  setTopSpeed(t) {
    this.topSpeed = t;
  }
  displayCarProps() {
    console.log(
      `Your car has ${this.doors} doors with a top speed of ${this.topSpeed}`
    );
  }
}

let sportsCar = new Car();

sportsCar.setDoors(2);
sportsCar.setTopSpeed(250);
sportsCar.displayCarProps();
```

See how many times sportsCar is unnecessarily repeated? We can get rid of it by using method chaining. To do so, instead of letting the setters just setting the value, return this at the end. This will allow us to perform operations on the object. After making this change, our code looks like:

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor() {
    this.doors = 4;
    this.topSpeed = 100;
  }
  setDoors(d) {
    this.doors = d;
    return this;
  }
  setTopSpeed(t) {
    this.topSpeed = t;
    return this;
  }
  displayCarProps() {
    console.log(
      `Your car has ${this.doors} doors with a top speed of ${this.topSpeed}`
    );
  }
}

let sportsCar = new Car().setDoors(2).setTopSpeed(250).displayCarProps();
```

Method chaining is also called fluent interface as it allows to operate on the object through methods without breaking the flow again and again by repeating the object. Since everything in JavaScript are objects we can apply method chaining also on functions, arrays, strings etc. (except null and undefined).

## The 4 pillars of OOP

- **Encapsulation:** OOP puts code in a container ('object') and organizes it into units, that model real world applications.
- **Abstraction:** Means hiding the complexity from the user by creating simpler interfaces.
- **Inheritance:** By inheriting from other classes we avoid writing the same code and we also save memory space by having shared methods
- **Polymorphism:** Is the ability to call the same method on different objects and each object responding in a different way. Actually, polymorphism is method overwriting or method overloading by adding extra parameters. Polymorphism is usefull because we can reuse some of the functionality from a superclass to adapt to a specific subclass.

## Reviewing Object Oriented Programming

So, did we obtain perfect object oriented programming? Well, that is up for debate. It is really up to you the developer to decide which style of writing you like best. We did learn that object oriented programming helps make you code more understandable, easy to extend, easy to maintain, memory efficient, and DRY!
