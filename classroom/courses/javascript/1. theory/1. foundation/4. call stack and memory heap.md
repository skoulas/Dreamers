## Intro

The JavaScript engine does a lot of work for us, but two of the biggest jobs are reading and executing code. We need a place to store and write our data and a place to keep track line by line of what's executing. That's where the call stack and the memory heap come in.

## Call Stack

The call stack keeps track of where we are in the code, so we can run the program in order.

```javascript
function subtractTwo(num) {
  return num - 2;
}

function calculate() {
  const sumTotal = 4 + 5;
  return subtractTwo(sumTotal);
}
debugger;
calculate();
```

Things are placed into the call stack on top and removed as they are finished. It runs in a last in first out (LIFO) mode. Each call stack can point to a location inside the memory heap.

### Stack Overflow

So what happens if you keep calling functions that are nested inside each other? When this happens it's called a stack overflow.

```javascript
// when a function calls itself, it is called RECURSION

function inception() {
  inception();
}

inception();

// returns Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

## Memory Heap

The memory heap is a place to store and write information so that we can use our memory appropriately. It is a place to allocate, use, and remove memory as needed. Think of it as a storage room of boxes that are unordered.

```javascript
// tell the memory heap to allocate memory for a number
const number = 17;

// allocate memory for a string
const string = 'some text';

// allocate memory for an object and it's values
const person = {
  first: 'George',
  last: 'Pilitsoglou',
};
```
