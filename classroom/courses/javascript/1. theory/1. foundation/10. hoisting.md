## Intro

Hoisting is the process of putting all variable and function declarations into memory during the compile phase.

## Functions

Functions are fully hoisted. Therefore a function can be called from anywhere in the code base. Function declarations on the other hand are not fully hoisted. Exempli gratia they are only initialized to undefined if declared with var.

## Var Variables

Var variables are hoisted and initialized to undefined. They are given a memory allocation and initialized a value of undefined until they are set to a value in line. So if a var variable is used in the code before it is initialized, then it will return undefined.

## Let & Const Variables

Let and const variables are hoisted but not initialized a value. If let and const are used before they are declared, then they will throw a reference error because they have not yet been initialized.

## Examples

```javascript
// function expression gets hoisted as undefined

var sing = function () {
  console.log('giwrgos');
};

// function declaration gets fully hoisted

function sing2() {
  console.log('giannis');
}

// var variable declaration gets hoisted as undefined

var favoriteFood = 'grapes';

//let and const variable declaration gets hoisted but not initialized a value

let favoriteFood = 'apples';
const favoriteFood = 'bananas';
```

## Best Practice

Avoid hoisting when possible. It can cause memory leaks and hard to catch bugs in your code. Use let and const as your go to variables.
