## Intro

**'This'** is the object that the function is a property of.

## The "this" Keyword

- gives methods acess to their objects
- executes same code for multible objects ('this' functions as a placeholder)

## Dynamic Scoped

The **'this'** Keyword is dynamically scoped. It doesn't matter where it is written but how the function is invoked. _(who called the function?)_

```javascript
const object = {
  sing () {
    console.log ('a: ', this);
    var anotherFunc = function() {
      console.log ('b: ', this);
    }
    anotherFunc()
  }
}

obj.sing() -->

a: object
b: window (global object)
```

How can we solve the above issue?

Arrow functions _(ES6)_ are lexically bound!

```javascript
const object = {
  sing () {
    console.log ('a: ', this);
    var anotherFunc = ()  => {
      console.log ('b: ', this);
    }
    anotherFunc()
  }
}

obj.sing() -->

a: object
b: object
```

--> The **this** Keyword obtains lexical begaviour. That means that wherever we write the function, thats what 'this' binds to.

---

## Context Vs Scope

**Context** is always the value of the reserved word **this** which is a reference to the object that owns the execution of the code. _(Context is object based)_

**Scope** defines the access to variables of a function when the function is invoked. _(Scope is function based)_

## The 4 Ways of this

### Implicit Binding

When we create an object the 'this' keyword will refer to the object in which it lives in. It is just implied. Therefore we dont have to do anything specific because this is just how the language works.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Alexandra',
  age: 26,
  hi() {
    console.log('hi' + this.name);
  },
};
```

### Explicit Binding

We can tell the 'this' Keyword explicitly to what to bind to. In the exaple below we bind 'this' to 'window'. Explicit binding uses the methods bind(), call() or apply().

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Fotis',
  age: 33,
  hi: function () {
    console.log('hi' + this.setTimeout);
  }.bind(window),
};
```

### Arrow Functions

With arrow function we can give the 'this' Keyword lexical scope (see above).

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Fotis',
  age: 33,
  hi: function () {
    var inner = () => {
      console.log('hi' + this.name);
    };
    return inner();
  },
};
```

A method with a function inside of it is the biggest gotcha when it comes to 'this'.

### The 'new' Keyword

The new keyword allows as to bind this to the instance that is created from the constructor function.

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

const personNo1 = new Person('Johannes', 28);
// this = personNo1
```
