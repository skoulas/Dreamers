## Intro

An Immediately Invoked Function Expression or more simply an IIFE is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. It can also be referred to as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function.

IIFEs are very useful because they don’t pollute the global namespace and they are a simple way to isolate variables declarations. Also IIFEs cannot be invoked again after they are once run.

## Syntax

This is the syntax that defines an IIFE:

```javascript
(function () {
  /* */
})();
```

IIFEs can be defined with arrow functions as well:

```javascript
(() => {
  /* */
})();
```

We basically have a function defined inside of parentheses, and then we append () to execute that function immediately.

You could also put the invoking parentheses inside the expression parentheses, there is no difference, just a styling preference.

```javascript
(function () {
  /* */
})();
```

```javascript
(() => {
  /* */
}())
```

Those wrapping parentheses are actually what make our function be considered an expression. Otherwise, the function declaration would be invalid, because we didn’t specify any name.

## Named IIFEs

IIFEs can also be named regular functions (not arrow functions). This does not change the fact that the function does not “leak” to the global scope, and it cannot be invoked again after its execution.

```javascript
(function doSomething() {
  /* */
})();
```
