## Intro

Most programming languages are block scoped, meaning every time you see a new { } (curly braces) is a new lexical environment. However, JavaScript is function scoped, meaning it only creates a new local environment if it sees the keyword function on the global scope. To give us access to block scope, in ES6 let and const were added to the language. Using these can prevent memory leaks, but there is still an argument to be made for using var.

## Function Scope

```javascript
function loop1() {
  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  console.log('final', i); // returns: final, 5
}
```

## Block Scope

```javascript
function loop2() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  console.log('final', i); // returns: error
}
```

## Let and Const

Variable declarations with let and const work differently from the var variable declaration. When an execution context is created and a lexical scope is entered, the engine allocates memory for any var variable in that scope and initializes it to undefined. The let and const variables only get initialized on the line they are executed on and only get allocated undefined if there is no assignment to the variable. Trying to access a let or const variable before it is declared or outside of its block without returning it will result in a Reference Error.

Remember:

- var is function scoped
- let and const are block scoped
