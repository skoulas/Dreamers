## Intro

An object is a built-in data type for storing key-value pairs. Data inside objects are unordered, and the values can be of any type.

A car is a simple example of an object, it has properties like brand name, model, color, condition, and methods like move forward, move backward, etc.
All of these properties are what define car characteristics as an object.

## Creating Objects

Objects can be created in different ways using:

- Object literal.
- Constructor function.
- Class
- Object.create()

### Object Literal

Simply declare a variable and assign its value to {}, and between these curly braces we add the properties in a key value pairs where key must be a string and value can be of any type e.g.

```javascript
let person = {
  firstName: 'George',
  lastName: 'Pilitsoglou',
  age: 34,
  isMarried: false,
  fullName: function () {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
};
```

#### shorthand property name syntax for object creation

The shorthand property name syntax in JavaScript allows creating objects without explicitly specifying the property names (ie. explicitly declaring the value after the key). In this process, an object is created where the property names of that object match variables which already exist in that context. Shorthand property names populate an object with a key matching the identifier and a value matching the identifierâ€™s value.

```javascript
const activity = 'Surfing';
const beach = { activity };
console.log(beach); // { activity: 'Surfing' }
```

### Constructor Functions

The constructor Function's syntax is like any regular function, but with tiny differences, let's take a look at how to make a constructor function to help us create Person Objects that shares the same properties and methods:

```javascript
// 1- Function name convention is to Capitalize first letter
function Person() {
  // properties to be assigned here. will leave it empty for now
}

// 2- Function execution must be preceded by "new" keyword
let george = new Person();

// What Happens under the hood:
// - "new" creates an empty object {}
// - "this" generated for us from function execution context
//   changed what it points to, to the new empty object created.
// - This function should not have a return statement
//   because it implicitly returns that object created
//   with all properties it may be attached to in function body.
console.log(george); // => Person {}

// Let's create the Person object properly now.
function Person(firstName, lastName, age, isMarried) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
  this.age = age;
  this.isMarried = isMarried;
}

// Create our person objects using Person constructor function
let george = new Person('George', 'Pilitsoglou', 34, false);
let sara = new Person('Sara', 'Badr', 22, false);
console.log(george);
//=> Person {firstName: "George", lastName: "Pilitsoglou",
//   age: 34, isMarried: false}
console.log(sara);
//=> Person {firstName: "Sara", lastName: "Badr",
//   age: 22, isMarried: false}
```

### Class

See chapter for classes.

### Object.create()

This method accepts two parameters

- 1st param is (mandatory): Object prototype (an object OR null).
- 2nd param is (optional) : PropertiesObject (a set of property descriptors)

## Properties and values of a JavaScript object

A JavaScript object literal is enclosed with curly braces {}. Values are mapped to keys in the object with a colon (:), and the key-value pairs are separated by commas. All the keys are unique, but values are not.

Key-value pairs of an object are also referred to as properties.

```javascript
const classOf2018 = {
  students: 38,
  year: 2018,
};
```

Properties like students and year in the example above, are properties of a type called Data Properties.

The other type of object properties is Accessor Properties, which are functions executed when getting or setting a value.

Accessor descriptor for this type of properties differs from data properties descriptor.

They have get getter method and set setter method, instead of value and writable.

### Javascript getters and setters restricted

JavaScript object properties are not private or protected. Since JavaScript objects are passed by reference, there is no way to fully prevent incorrect interactions with object properties.

One way to implement more restricted interactions with object properties is to use getter and setter methods.

Typically, the internal value is stored as a property with an identifier that matches the getter and setter method names, but begins with an underscore (\_).

```javascript
const myCat = {
  _name: 'Dottie',
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  },
  set name(newName) {
    this._name = newName;
  },
};

// Reference invokes the getter
console.log(myCat.name);

// Assignment invokes the setter
myCat.name = 'Yankee';
```

### getters and setters intercept property access

JavaScript getter and setter methods are helpful in part because they offer a way to intercept property access and assignment, and allow for additional actions to be performed before these changes go into effect.

```javascript
const myCat = {
  _name: 'Snickers',
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  },
  set name(newName) {
    //Verify that newName is a non-empty string before setting as name property
    if (typeof newName === 'string' && newName.length > 0) {
      this._name = newName;
    } else {
      console.log('ERROR: name must be a non-empty string');
    }
  },
};
```

### Restrictions in Naming Properties

```javascript
// Example of invalid key names
const trainSchedule = {
  platform num: 10, // Invalid because of the space between words.
  40 - 10 + 2: 30, // Expressions cannot be keys.
  +compartment: 'C' // The use of a + sign is invalid unless it is enclosed in quotations.
}
```

## Access object properties

### Dot Notation for Accessing Object Properties

Properties of a JavaScript object can be accessed using the dot notation in this manner: object.propertyName. Nested properties of an object can be accessed by chaining key names in the correct order.

```javascript
const apple = {
  color: 'Green',
  price: {
    bulk: '$3/kg',
    smallQty: '$4/kg',
  },
};
console.log(apple.color); // 'Green'
console.log(apple.price.bulk); // '$3/kg'
```

### Bracket Notation for Accessing Object Properties

Properties of a JavaScript object can be accessed using the bracket notation in this manner: object[propertyName]. Nested properties of an object can be accessed by chaining key names in the correct order.

```javascript
// Dot Notation:
// Object name followed by DOT followed by property name.
console.log(person.firstName);
console.log(person.fullName());

// Bracket Notation:
// Object name followed by [] and property name passed between
// brackets wrapped with single or double quotes
console.log(person['firstName']);

// We can use a variable that holds value of property name
// Only Bracket notation valid when passing variables
let userAge = 'age';
console.log(person[userAge]);

// Property name string that includes space, can't be accessed
// using Dot notation, so we use Bracket notation instead.
console.log(car.brand name); // Throw Error => Uncaught SyntaxError
console.log(car['brand name']);

// Accessing nested properties
console.log(person.address.city); // => Alexandria
console.log(person['address']['city']; // => Alexandria
```

### Accessing non-existent JavaScript properties

When trying to access a JavaScript object property that has not been defined yet, the value of undefined will be returned by default.

```javascript
const classElection = {
  date: 'January 12',
};

console.log(classElection.place); // undefined
```

### JavaScript destructuring assignment shorthand syntax

The JavaScript destructuring assignment is a shorthand syntax that allows object properties to be extracted into specific variable values.

It uses a pair of curly braces ({}) with property names on the left-hand side of an assignment to extract values from objects. The number of variables can be less than the total properties of an object.

```javascript
const rubiksCubeFacts = {
  possiblePermutations: '43,252,003,274,489,856,000',
  invented: '1974',
  largestCube: '17x17x17',
};
const { possiblePermutations, invented, largestCube } = rubiksCubeFacts;
console.log(possiblePermutations); // '43,252,003,274,489,856,000'
console.log(invented); // '1974'
console.log(largestCube); // '17x17x17'
```

## Listing object properties

Using Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries() methods:

```javascript
// Object.keys() =>
// returns array of properties keys
let keys = Object.keys(employee);
console.log(keys); // => ['name', 'age'];

// Object.values() =>
// returns array of properties values

let values = Object.values(employee);
console.log(values); // => ['John', 32];

// Object.entries() =>
// returns array of properties in [key, value] pair
let properties = Object.entries(employee);
console.log(properties); // => [['name', 'john'], ['age', 32]];

// * Because isActive is not enumerable property
// It's not listed in any of the above methods
```

### JavaScript for...in loop

The JavaScript for...in loop can be used to iterate over the keys of an object. In each iteration, one of the properties from the object is assigned to the variable of that loop.

```javascript
let mobile = {
  brand: 'Samsung',
  model: 'Galaxy Note 9',
};

for (let key in mobile) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${mobile[key]}`);
}
```

## JavaScript Objects are Mutable

JavaScript objects are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed, even when they are declared as const. New properties can be added, and existing property values can be changed or deleted.

It is the reference to the object, bound to the variable, that cannot be changed.

```javascript
const student = {
  name: 'Sheldon',
  score: 100,
  grade: 'A',
};

console.log(student);
// { name: 'Sheldon', score: 100, grade: 'A' }

delete student.score;
student.grade = 'F';
console.log(student);
// { name: 'Sheldon', grade: 'F' }

student = {};
// TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

## Delete operator

Once an object is created in JavaScript, it is possible to remove properties from the object using the delete operator. The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself from the object. The delete operator only works on properties, not on variables or functions.

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: 'Matilda',
  age: 27,
  hobby: 'knitting',
  goal: 'learning JavaScript',
};

delete person.hobby; // or delete person[hobby];

console.log(person);
/*
{
  firstName: "Matilda"
  age: 27
  goal: "learning JavaScript"
}
*/
```

## Javascript passing objects as arguments

When JavaScript objects are passed as arguments to functions or methods, they are passed by reference, not by value. This means that the object itself (not a copy) is accessible and mutable (can be changed) inside that function.

```javascript
const origNum = 8;
const origObj = { color: 'blue' };

const changeItUp = (num, obj) => {
  num = 7;
  obj.color = 'red';
};

changeItUp(origNum, origObj);

// Will output 8 since integers are passed by value.
console.log(origNum);

// Will output 'red' since objects are passed
// by reference and are therefore mutable.
console.log(origObj.color);
```

## JavaScript Object Methods

JavaScript objects may have property values that are functions. These are referred to as object methods.

Methods may be defined using anonymous arrow function expressions, or with shorthand method syntax.

Object methods are invoked with the syntax: objectName.methodName(arguments).

```javascript
const engine = {
  // method shorthand, with one argument
  start(adverb) {
    console.log(`The engine starts up ${adverb}...`);
  },
  // anonymous arrow function expression with no arguments
  sputter: () => {
    console.log('The engine sputters...');
  },
};

engine.start('noisily');
engine.sputter();

/* Console output:
The engine starts up noisily...
The engine sputters...
*/
```

## this Keyword

This is the object that the function is a property of.
Alternatively it refers to a methodâ€™s calling object.
It can be used to access properties belonging to that object.

Here, using the this keyword inside the object function to refer to the cat object and access its name property.

```javascript
const cat = {
  name: 'Pipey',
  age: 8,
  whatName() {
    return this.name;
  },
};

console.log(cat.whatName());
// Output: Pipey
```

## javascript function this

Every JavaScript function or method has a this context. For a function defined inside of an object, this will refer to that object itself. For a function defined outside of an object, this will refer to the global object (window in a browser, global in Node.js).

```javascript
const restaurant = {
  numCustomers: 45,
  seatCapacity: 100,
  availableSeats() {
    // this refers to the restaurant object
    // and it's used to access its properties
    return this.seatCapacity - this.numCustomers;
  },
};
```

## JavaScript Arrow Function this Scope

Some people think of arrow functions as just being syntactic sugar for a regular function, but arrow functions work a bit differently than a regular function. They are a compact alternative to a regular function, but also without its own bindings to <b>this</b>, <b>arguments</b>, <b>super</b> or <b>new.target</b> keywords. Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors and are not the best option for methods.

Consider the example code:

loggerA is a property that uses arrow notation to define the function. Since data does not exist in the global context, accessing this.data returns undefined.

loggerB uses method syntax. Since this refers to the enclosing object, the value of the data property is accessed as expected, returning "abc".

```javascript
const myObj = {
  data: 'abc',
  loggerA: () => {
    console.log(this.data);
  },
  loggerB() {
    console.log(this.data);
  },
};

myObj.loggerA(); // undefined
myObj.loggerB(); // 'abc'
```

````javascript
var obj = {
  // does not create a new scope
  i: 10,
  b: () => console.log(this.i, this),
  c: function () {
    console.log(this.i, this);
  },
};
obj.b(); // prints undefined, Window {...} (or the global object)
obj.c(); // prints 10, Object {...}```
````

## javascript factory functions

A JavaScript function that returns an object is known as a factory function. Factory functions often accept parameters in order to customize the returned object.

```javascript
// A factory function that accepts 'name',
// 'age', and 'breed' parameters to return
// a customized dog object.
const dogFactory = (name, age, breed) => {
  return {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    breed: breed,
    bark() {
      console.log('Woof!');
    },
  };
};
```

## Property descriptors

What's really interesting now is the property descriptors? What is that?

As the name implies, It describes or gives us information about the property at hand.

Let's clarify this with an example:

```javascript
let person = Object.create(
  {}, // prototype
  {
    firstName: {
      // property name
      value: 'George', // property value
      writable: true, // property value can be overridden after creation or not
      enumerable: true, // is property accessible when the objectâ€™s properties are enumerated using the for...in loop or Object.keys() method.
      configurable: true, // does user has permission to change property descriptor, such as changing writable or enumerable.
    },
    lastName: {
      value: 'Pilitsoglou',
      writable: false,
      enumerable: false,
      configurable: true,
    },
    // and another property and so on...
  }
);
```

If configurable is set to false, this can't be undone, we won't have the ability to change this property descriptor anymore, which can be helpful when you don't want anyone to change the recommended behavior of your object.

```javascript
// because lastName property writable option is set to false,
// this line won't have any effect on its value
person.lastName = 'Adam';
console.log(person.lastName); // => Pilitsoglou;

// Listing all object's properties names (keys)
let personKeys = Object.keys(person); // returns array of object keys
console.log(personKeys); // => ["firstName"]
// Because "lastName" enumerable is set to false,
// It's not listed in object's array of keys
```

What if we've already an object created with object literal.
How to view the descriptor for a specific property?

Let's find how to accomplish this the following method:
Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(objName, propertName);

```javascript
let car = {
  brandName: 'BMW',
  model: '320i',
}

let brandNameDescriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(car, 'brandName'));
console.log(brandNameDescriptor); // =>
// {
//   configurable: true
//   enumerable: true
//   value: "BMW"
//   writable: true
// }
```

Object.defineProperty(obj, prop, descriptor)
This method will allow us to add a new property with descriptor or even modify an existing property descriptor.

```javascript
Object.defineProperty(car, 'modelYear', {
  configurable: true,
  enumerable: true,
  value: 2020,
  writable: true,
});
```

Before we end talking about property descriptors, there are other Object related methods that affect property descriptors.

Object.freeze() and Object.seal() methods.

Object.freeze(objToBeFrozen)
This will prevent adding or removing properties from the frozen object, was it data properties or accessor properties.
Data properties value cannot be changed and writable and configurable is set to false
Accessor properties will act as if it's working, but it's not.

Note that property values of type Object can still be changed unless it's frozen too.

Object.seal() definition on MDN, clarify how it is different from Object.freeze().

```
The Object.seal() method seals an object, preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. Values of present properties can still be changed as long as they are writable.
```
