## Intro

An object is a built-in data type for storing key-value pairs. Data inside objects are unordered, and the values can be of any type.

## Restrictions in Naming Properties

```javascript
// Example of invalid key names
const trainSchedule = {
  platform num: 10, // Invalid because of the space between words.
  40 - 10 + 2: 30, // Expressions cannot be keys.
  +compartment: 'C' // The use of a + sign is invalid unless it is enclosed in quotations.
}
```

## Properties and values of a JavaScript object

A JavaScript object literal is enclosed with curly braces {}. Values are mapped to keys in the object with a colon (:), and the key-value pairs are separated by commas. All the keys are unique, but values are not.

Key-value pairs of an object are also referred to as properties.

```javascript
const classOf2018 = {
  students: 38,
  year: 2018,
};
```

## shorthand property name syntax for object creation

The shorthand property name syntax in JavaScript allows creating objects without explicitly specifying the property names (ie. explicitly declaring the value after the key). In this process, an object is created where the property names of that object match variables which already exist in that context. Shorthand property names populate an object with a key matching the identifier and a value matching the identifier’s value.

```javascript
const activity = 'Surfing';
const beach = { activity };
console.log(beach); // { activity: 'Surfing' }
```

## Dot Notation for Accessing Object Properties

Properties of a JavaScript object can be accessed using the dot notation in this manner: object.propertyName. Nested properties of an object can be accessed by chaining key names in the correct order.

```javascript
const apple = {
  color: 'Green',
  price: {
    bulk: '$3/kg',
    smallQty: '$4/kg',
  },
};
console.log(apple.color); // 'Green'
console.log(apple.price.bulk); // '$3/kg'
```

## Accessing non-existent JavaScript properties

When trying to access a JavaScript object property that has not been defined yet, the value of undefined will be returned by default.

```javascript
const classElection = {
  date: 'January 12',
};

console.log(classElection.place); // undefined
```

## JavaScript Objects are Mutable

JavaScript objects are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed, even when they are declared as const. New properties can be added, and existing property values can be changed or deleted.

It is the reference to the object, bound to the variable, that cannot be changed.

```javascript
const student = {
  name: 'Sheldon',
  score: 100,
  grade: 'A',
};

console.log(student);
// { name: 'Sheldon', score: 100, grade: 'A' }

delete student.score;
student.grade = 'F';
console.log(student);
// { name: 'Sheldon', grade: 'F' }

student = {};
// TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

## JavaScript for...in loop

The JavaScript for...in loop can be used to iterate over the keys of an object. In each iteration, one of the properties from the object is assigned to the variable of that loop.

```javascript
let mobile = {
  brand: 'Samsung',
  model: 'Galaxy Note 9',
};

for (let key in mobile) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${mobile[key]}`);
}
```

## Delete operator

Once an object is created in JavaScript, it is possible to remove properties from the object using the delete operator. The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself from the object. The delete operator only works on properties, not on variables or functions.

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: 'Matilda',
  age: 27,
  hobby: 'knitting',
  goal: 'learning JavaScript',
};

delete person.hobby; // or delete person[hobby];

console.log(person);
/*
{
  firstName: "Matilda"
  age: 27
  goal: "learning JavaScript"
}
*/
```

## javascript passing objects as arguments

When JavaScript objects are passed as arguments to functions or methods, they are passed by reference, not by value. This means that the object itself (not a copy) is accessible and mutable (can be changed) inside that function.

```javascript
const origNum = 8;
const origObj = { color: 'blue' };

const changeItUp = (num, obj) => {
  num = 7;
  obj.color = 'red';
};

changeItUp(origNum, origObj);

// Will output 8 since integers are passed by value.
console.log(origNum);

// Will output 'red' since objects are passed
// by reference and are therefore mutable.
console.log(origObj.color);
```

## JavaScript Object Methods

JavaScript objects may have property values that are functions. These are referred to as object methods.

Methods may be defined using anonymous arrow function expressions, or with shorthand method syntax.

Object methods are invoked with the syntax: objectName.methodName(arguments).

```javascript
const engine = {
  // method shorthand, with one argument
  start(adverb) {
    console.log(`The engine starts up ${adverb}...`);
  },
  // anonymous arrow function expression with no arguments
  sputter: () => {
    console.log('The engine sputters...');
  },
};

engine.start('noisily');
engine.sputter();

/* Console output:
The engine starts up noisily...
The engine sputters...
*/
```

## JavaScript destructuring assignment shorthand syntax

The JavaScript destructuring assignment is a shorthand syntax that allows object properties to be extracted into specific variable values.

It uses a pair of curly braces ({}) with property names on the left-hand side of an assignment to extract values from objects. The number of variables can be less than the total properties of an object.

```javascript
const rubiksCubeFacts = {
  possiblePermutations: '43,252,003,274,489,856,000',
  invented: '1974',
  largestCube: '17x17x17',
};
const { possiblePermutations, invented, largestCube } = rubiksCubeFacts;
console.log(possiblePermutations); // '43,252,003,274,489,856,000'
console.log(invented); // '1974'
console.log(largestCube); // '17x17x17'
```

## this Keyword

This is the object that the function is a property of.
Alternatively it refers to a method’s calling object.
It can be used to access properties belonging to that object.

Here, using the this keyword inside the object function to refer to the cat object and access its name property.

```javascript
const cat = {
  name: 'Pipey',
  age: 8,
  whatName() {
    return this.name;
  },
};

console.log(cat.whatName());
// Output: Pipey
```

## javascript function this

Every JavaScript function or method has a this context. For a function defined inside of an object, this will refer to that object itself. For a function defined outside of an object, this will refer to the global object (window in a browser, global in Node.js).

```javascript
const restaurant = {
  numCustomers: 45,
  seatCapacity: 100,
  availableSeats() {
    // this refers to the restaurant object
    // and it's used to access its properties
    return this.seatCapacity - this.numCustomers;
  },
};
```

## JavaScript Arrow Function this Scope

Some people think of arrow functions as just being syntactic sugar for a regular function, but arrow functions work a bit differently than a regular function. They are a compact alternative to a regular function, but also without its own bindings to <b>this</b>, <b>arguments</b>, <b>super</b> or <b>new.target</b> keywords. Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors and are not the best option for methods.

Consider the example code:

loggerA is a property that uses arrow notation to define the function. Since data does not exist in the global context, accessing this.data returns undefined.

loggerB uses method syntax. Since this refers to the enclosing object, the value of the data property is accessed as expected, returning "abc".

```javascript
const myObj = {
  data: 'abc',
  loggerA: () => {
    console.log(this.data);
  },
  loggerB() {
    console.log(this.data);
  },
};

myObj.loggerA(); // undefined
myObj.loggerB(); // 'abc'
```

````javascript
var obj = {
  // does not create a new scope
  i: 10,
  b: () => console.log(this.i, this),
  c: function () {
    console.log(this.i, this);
  },
};
obj.b(); // prints undefined, Window {...} (or the global object)
obj.c(); // prints 10, Object {...}```
````

## getters and setters intercept property access

JavaScript getter and setter methods are helpful in part because they offer a way to intercept property access and assignment, and allow for additional actions to be performed before these changes go into effect.

```javascript
const myCat = {
  _name: 'Snickers',
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  },
  set name(newName) {
    //Verify that newName is a non-empty string before setting as name property
    if (typeof newName === 'string' && newName.length > 0) {
      this._name = newName;
    } else {
      console.log('ERROR: name must be a non-empty string');
    }
  },
};
```

## javascript getters and setters restricted

JavaScript object properties are not private or protected. Since JavaScript objects are passed by reference, there is no way to fully prevent incorrect interactions with object properties.

One way to implement more restricted interactions with object properties is to use getter and setter methods.

Typically, the internal value is stored as a property with an identifier that matches the getter and setter method names, but begins with an underscore (\_).

```javascript
const myCat = {
  _name: 'Dottie',
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  },
  set name(newName) {
    this._name = newName;
  },
};

// Reference invokes the getter
console.log(myCat.name);

// Assignment invokes the setter
myCat.name = 'Yankee';
```

## javascript factory functions

A JavaScript function that returns an object is known as a factory function. Factory functions often accept parameters in order to customize the returned object.

```javascript
// A factory function that accepts 'name',
// 'age', and 'breed' parameters to return
// a customized dog object.
const dogFactory = (name, age, breed) => {
  return {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    breed: breed,
    bark() {
      console.log('Woof!');
    },
  };
};
```
